            <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
            <p>
                I am ThatJamGuy. I am a hobbyist with various skills involving Game Development, Digital Music Production, general programming, and running a YouTube channel. <br>
                In terms of Game Development, a lot of my larger projects (Most just SCP - Containment Breach Revival right now) are open source, so contributions are always welcome. <br>
                I have created myself a studio called "VectorArts Entertainment", which is the primary thing you will see credited on my games from this point forward, but know that it's mostly just me.
